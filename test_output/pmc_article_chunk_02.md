Cerebral edema and hemorrhagic transformation (HT) are significant complications of ischemic stroke, leading to extended hospital stays for stroke patients. Around 3–40% of patients who suffer from ischemic stroke may develop HT. Also, using tPA and endovascular therapy has been shown to exacerbate HT (Mirzahosseini et al., 2023a).



We found that pharmacological modulation of p75NTR using LM11A-31 or genetically knocking down p75NTR in mice significantly reduces cerebral edema, infarction, and HT following ischemic stroke in mice. Our results align with prior research indicating that knocking down p75NTR can have a neuroprotective effect, reducing infarction in stroke (Qin et al., 2022). This research showed that administration of LM11A-31 reduced inflammation, including tumor necrosis factor-α/nuclear factor (NF)-κBp65 following stroke in mice. p75NTR activation triggers the production of NF-κB signaling, and NF-κBp65 has been demonstrated to have detrimental effects on cerebral ischemia. NF-κB activation initiates neuronal damage and stimulates microglial cells, which can produce inflammatory markers.

Our evidence indicated that p75NTR modulation decreases cell apoptosis by reducing Bax and increasing Bcl-2 protein expression. Bax and Bcl-2 are proteins with pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic roles, respectively. The interplay between Bcl-2 and Bax, regulating survival and death signals, ultimately determines the fate of cells (Singh et al., 2019). Additionally, we found that administration of LM11A-31 or genetically knocking down p75NTR inhibits the protein expression of JNK/RhoA following ischemic stroke in mice. JNK is a target of RhoA, known as stress-activated kinase, belonging to the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. JNK activation results in apoptosis, neurodegeneration, and ischemia-reperfusion processes.

In this study, inhibition of p75NTR resulted in upregulation of Akt signaling following ischemic stroke in mice. It has been demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of Akt operates through phosphorylation and inactivation of downstream signaling pathways such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3), Bcl-2, JNK, and apoptotic p53. Moreover, genetically knocking down p75NTR downregulated the protein level of GSK3 following stroke. GSK3 has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation and ischemia/reperfusion injury in brain endothelial cells. We did not observe a significant difference in the protein level of extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) following administration of LM11A-31 in mouse models of ischemic stroke.

Stroke disrupts the level of tight junction proteins, and there have been reports indicating that upregulation of p75NTR impairs BBB permeability. BBB impairment leads to the production of inflammatory markers in the ischemic brain. Our results illustrated that the genetic knocking down of p75NTR improved BBB integrity by increasing the protein expression of ZO-1 and occludin. ERK1/2, NF-κB, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α are among the markers that regulate the expression of occludin and ZO-1 (Rochfort and Cummins, 2015).

Furthermore, the data showed that genetically knocking down p75NTR improves sensory motor function following ischemic stroke in mice. Speed and pressure-related parameters were significantly improved in p75NTR+/– mice compared to the wild-type mice following ischemic stroke. These results indicate that knocking down p75NTR resulted in less brain injury than the wild-type mice.

Taken together, this is the first report illustrating the role of pharmacological modulation of p75NTR using LM11A-31 or genetically knocking down p75NTR to decrease the cerebral infarction, edema, HT, cell apoptosis, and promote neuroprotection following intraluminal filament and photothrombotic model in mice. The evidence indicates that modulation of p75NTR shows a promising approach in advancing stroke therapy. The summary of the hypothesis and findings has been illustrated in **Figure 1**. The findings illustrated in the study underscore the potential mechanisms and neuroprotective effects associated with p75NTR, shedding light on its role in neuronal survival following ischemic stroke. Additionally, discovering combinatorial approaches, including integrating p75NTR modulation with existing therapeutic agents, may yield a synergist effect and improve the outcome of ischemic stroke.

The research hypothesis of p75NTR modulation in ischemic stroke in mice.

Pharmacological modulation of p75NTR using LM11A-31 or genetically knocking down p75NTR improves the outcome of ischemic stroke in mice through reducing cerebral infarction, cerebral edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation. Also, it promoted neuronal survival and neuroprotection. Created with BioRender.com. ERK1/2: Extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2; GSK3: glycogen synthase kinase 3β; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NF-κB: nuclear factor-κB; p75NTR: p75 neurotrophin receptor; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor-α.

Our findings suggest that LM11A-31 can be a potential therapeutic agent for addressing ischemic stroke. However, it is crucial to conduct a long-term study to determine how modulating p75NTR affects cognitive function in mice post-stroke. Additionally, the role of p75NTR modulation should be investigated in females post-stroke.
