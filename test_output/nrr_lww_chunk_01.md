The challenge of protecting the brain resides in the unique characteristics of neurons, as they are postmitotic, long-lived, excitable, and polarized cells with long and fragile axons and dendrites. The complexity of the multiple potential cell death pathways further complicates this issue. In addition, the immature brain is prone to a “cell death continuum,” which involves intricate molecular interconnections between cell death processes. This makes finding safe and effective neuroprotective strategies to prevent damage to the developing brain a significant challenge in neonatology. The only approved treatment for term newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is therapeutic hypothermia. However, access to this treatment and its effectiveness is limited to a few cases. Research is focused on developing new neuroprotective agents that can be combined with hypothermia to improve its therapeutic window and outcome.

We and others have demonstrated that neuronal autophagy is enhanced after hypoxia-ischemia and/or excitotoxicity in primary neuronal cultures (Ginet et al., 2014b; Descloux et al., 2018), rodent pups (Liu et al., 2013; Ginet et al., 2014b; Xie et al., 2016; Descloux et al., 2018), and brain sections of human newborns with severe HIE (Ginet et al., 2014a; Xie et al., 2016). Genetic downregulation of BECLIN1 (BECN1) (Ginet et al., 2014b), neuron-specific knockout of autophagy-related genes (atg) 7 (Xie et al., 2016) or pharmacological autophagy inhibition (Descloux et al., 2018) provides neuroprotection in these different preclinical models of perinatal brain injuries. A better understanding of the connections between enhanced autophagy and neuronal death may open the door to developing new therapeutic options for HIE.

Indeed, the specific process by which autophagy, an important physiological and adaptive mechanism, is converted into a deleterious one remains unknown. The role of autophagy in cell death has long been controversial, particularly in pathogenesis rather than development. This emphasizes the critical need for further research to unravel the complexities of autophagy and its potential involvement in cell death (Clarke and Puyal, 2012). Enhanced autophagy, characterized by an unusually high presence of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, has traditionally been viewed as the primary characteristic of autophagic cell death—an additional form of cell death alongside apoptosis and necrosis. In addition to these predominant types of cell death, various forms of programmed cell death have been identified and classified based not only on ultrastructural morphological features but also on molecular, pharmacological, and functional properties (Klionsky et al., 2021; Park et al., 2023). Among these diverse forms of programmed cell death, autosis has been recently described as a distinct type of autophagic cell death with specific morphological and molecular features. This discovery provides compelling evidence for the involvement of autophagy as a direct initiator of cell death.

The morphological definition of autosis includes the presence of numerous autophagosomes, autolysosomes, and empty vacuoles in the cytoplasm during the initial phase, such as during “classical” autophagic cell death. However, during the second phase, a focal swelling of the perinuclear space (PNS) occurs, and this swelling is considered the primary morphological signature of autosis (Liu et al., 2013; **[Figure 1](javascript:void\(0\))**). In the late stage, a reduced number of autophagosomes/autolysosomes is accompanied by necrotic-like features such as organelle swelling and loss of plasma membrane integrity (as observed during “classical” necrosis). The focal swelling of PNS facing a concave nucleus at this stage serves as the main criterion for differentiating autosis from necrosis. This raises the question of whether autosis may have been underestimated or misinterpreted as necrotic cell death in certain pathological conditions, and whether all reported forms of autophagic cell death are instances of autosis or if autosis represents a distinct type of autophagic cell death. The specific morphological and molecular characteristics of autosis suggest that there are now tools available to systematically investigate these possibilities.

**Morphological features of neuronal autosis.** Neuronal autosis is divided into two main phases as illustrated in the different schemes and representative electron micrographs of CA3 hippocampal dying neurons after hypoxic-ischemic injury in a rat preclinical perinatal model. During the first stage of phase 1 (phase 1a), numerous autophagosomes, autolysosomes, and empty vacuoles are observed. The PNS appears normal, but chromatin condensation begins without forming well-defined clumps as seen in apoptosis. Some mitochondria are electron-dense, and the ER appears dilated and fragmented. During phase 1b, the nucleus starts to convolute, and some restricted regions of the PNS (blue arrows) display swelling and contain membranous structures with cytosol-resembling content. During the second phase autophagosomes and autolysosomes became scarce, and dying neurons have a necrotic-like morphology. Almost all organelles are swollen and fragmented, and the plasma membrane is ruptured (arrowhead). At this stage, the main morphological criterion to distinguish autosis from necrosis is the presence of a focal ballooning of the PNS facing a concave nucleus, which is the morphological signature of autosis.
