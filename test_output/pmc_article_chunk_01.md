Stroke is a significant leading cause of death and disability in the United States (Tsao et al., 2022). Approximately 87% of strokes fall into the ischemic category, mainly caused by arterial blockage (Jayaraj et al., 2019). Although the only FDA-approved effective medication is tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), it should be administrated within 4.5 hours of ischemic stroke. Furthermore, tPA has been an integral part of managing acute ischemic stroke. However, it increases the development of intracerebral hemorrhage (Goncalves et al., 2022). Therefore, discovering a novel neuroprotective drug is a high clinical need. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the utilization of thrombectomy procedures.

Neurotrophins (NTs) have been shown to contribute to several neurological diseases, including stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. NTs are produced in a proform and then cleaved to a mature form.

NTs include nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4 (Huang and Reichardt, 2001). NTs interact with two main receptors, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and tyrosine receptor kinase. p75NTR belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. It is expressed in many cell types and plays a pivotal role in several cell functions, including apoptosis, survival, differentiation, and migration. During the developmental stage, p75NTR is extensively expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous system. However, as neurons mature into adulthood, their expression is downregulated. This receptor is highly upregulated in several neurological diseases, including stroke and dementia. p75NTR activation triggers the activation of multiple signaling pathways, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase-p53-Bcl-2 associated X protein (JNK-p53-Bax) (Mirzahosseini et al., 2023b). Previous reports have shown that downregulation of p75NTR mitigates neuroinflammation and promotes neurogenesis.

LM11A-31 is a novel p75NTR ligand that is hydrophilic and orally bioavailable. This compound is in phase 2 clinical trials for mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease ([NCT03069014](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03069014)). This non-peptide ligand can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Researchers have shown that LM11A-31 effectively improves several brain diseases, including cerebral ischemia and pneumoniae meningitis. It has been shown that modulation of p75NTR using LM11A-31 significantly reduced neuroinflammation, cholinergic degeneration, inflammation, and improved memory in mouse models of Huntington’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease (Simmons et al., 2016). Recently, our research illustrated that LM11A-31 improves BBB permeability and motor function and reduces brain injury (Nasoohi et al., 2023). Suppressing p75NTR resulted in decreased brain damage and improved motor function in traumatic brain injury, mitigating Tau’s phosphorylation in the pR5 model (Sebastiani et al., 2015). Moreover, LM11A-31 reduces apoptosis in oligodendrocyte cells and preserved myelinated axons in a mouse model of spinal cord injury (James et al., 2017). The basis of the therapeutic approach for this compound lies in its ability to modulate the dimerization, activation, and interaction of NT receptors with co-receptors, utilizing a distinct mechanism compared to naturally occurring peptides (Meeker and Williams, 2015). Our hypothesis is that modulation of p75NTR either pharmacologically or genetically enhances the functional outcome of ischemic stroke in mice.

In this study, we utilized two distinct stroke models: intraluminal filament and photothrombotic models (Mirzahosseini et al., 2023a). The choice of stroke models depends on the specific research objectives. The intraluminal filament model closely simulates human ischemic stroke but carries the risk of hemorrhage with various types of sutures. This model has a higher mortality and infection risk than the photothrombotic model. Moreover, it induces severe and prolonged neurological deficits, making it challenging to assess behavioral function. The photothrombotic model is minimally invasive, with a high survival rate (Salman et al., 2023). It is known for its high reproducibility and minimal variation in infarction size. Moreover, we utilized two time points, including 24 and 72 hours to assess the impact of p75NTR modulation at both early and subacute stages post-stroke in mice. We induced ischemic stroke using an intraluminal filament model for 24 hours to understand the early mechanisms post-stroke. Subsequently, we opted to induce ischemic stroke using the photothrombotic model for 72 hours to investigate the potential role of p75NTR modulation in the subacute stage post-stroke. In this study, due to previous reports highlighting behavioral dysfunction and small body shape in p75NTR knock-out homozygous mice, we employed p75NTR heterozygous mice to induce ischemic stroke (Sebastiani et al., 2015). We administrated 50 mg/kg LM11A-31 at 1 hour following intraluminal stroke in wild-type mice.
